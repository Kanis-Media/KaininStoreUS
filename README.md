## Devleopment testing enviorment (2/5/2026)

An azure app service with local git CD can be used for a preview environment for backend changes with the test static webapp can be used for the front end

to commit to the app service 

```console
git remote add azure https://<username>@<app>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app>.git

git subtree push --prefix path/to/yourAppService azure HEAD:master
```

If you want to upload to the front end you can use the SWA cli

```console
# Install az SWA cli globally if you have not already
npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli

# cd into build file and deploy 
cd build/
swa deploy
```


## Testing webhooks with ngrok 

to test webhooks utilize ngrok and the desired senders subscription sign up (Ex: sqaure) to facilate a network tunnel to easily create a public URL

### ngrok config.yml file example 
```yml
version: "3"
tunnels:
    frontend:
        proto: http
        addr: 3000
        host_header: "localhost:3000"
        inspect: false
    backend:
        proto: http
        addr: 4000
        host_header: "localhost:4000"
        inspect: false
agent:
    authtoken: # Your auuth token (really should be added using the terminal cmd ngrok config add-authtoken authtoken) 
```


## React Node Template Notes 
This app was made uisng the React Node Template "a simple, unopinionated, full stack web app template, with the goal of facilitating quick prototyping and deployment to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or elsewhere."

This template combines a **client** generated by `create-react-app` and a **server** generated by `express-generator`.

In local dev, the React dev server & Node server are run side by side, with API calls [proxied](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) through the React dev server to the Node server. In production, the Node app will serve both the static React production build and the API.

This project can be deployed as is to Heroku; the `heroku-postbuild` script will generate a production build of the React app and the `start` script will kick off the Node server.

**See it deployed here:** https://react-node-temp.herokuapp.com/

## Development

### Project Structure

- `src/client` contains the [React](https://reactjs.org/) app
- `src/server` contains the [Node](https://nodejs.org/) [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) app
- `package.json` in the project root contains scripts to run in dev mode locally, and also to build and run on Heroku

### Local Dev Setup

All commands run from project root:

1. `cd src/client && npm install`
2. `cd src/server && npm install`
3. Make sure `nodemon` & `concurrently` are installed globally
4. `npm run dev`

You will now see the output of both the React dev server and the Node server in your shell, running at the same time thanks to `concurrently`. Enjoy!

### Client<->Server Communication

The Node Express.js server is initialized with one router mounted at `/api`. We've implemented a sample route at `/api/users`. Edit the `src/server/routes/api.js` file to add your own routes and server-side logic.

In the React app, you can see in `src/client/src/App.js` where we're calling `/api/users` using `fetch`. `App.js` is a [functional component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components), so you can see how we're using `useEffect` to call our API on component mount, and `useState` to update component state when we receive a response from the API.

## Deployment

### Heroku

This project can be deployed as is to Heroku. Check out the [Heroku deployment guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment) for more info. Some of the most popular deployment strategies include:

- [Deploying with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) (pushing to Heroku as a remote)
- [Deploying with GitHub](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) (connecting Heroku to your GitHub account)

### Elsewhere

Deploying to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/deploy-nodejs-web-app/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/), etc should work similarly. Just make sure to run the `heroku-postbuild` script, which generates the React production files, before the `start` entry point is hit. Depending on your use case and hosting infrastructure, it might make sense to [Dockerize](https://nodejs.org/de/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/) this template.
